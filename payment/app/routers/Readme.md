## Routers (Functions):


## Purpose: 
Routers handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate endpoint functions.

## Why Functions?:
Functions are well-suited for handling specific routes (e.g., GET, POST, PUT).
Each endpoint function corresponds to a specific API route.
Functions encapsulate the logic for processing requests and generating responses.
